# AMARO: Advanced Machine-learning Atomic Representation Omni-force-field

We introduce AMARO (Advanced Machine-learning Atomic Representation Omni-force-field), a novel neural network potential that integrates the O(3)-equivariant message-passing TensorNet architecture with a hydrogen-excluding coarse-graining approach. AMARO demonstrates the feasibility of training coarser NNP, without
prior energy terms, to run stable protein dynamics with scalability and generalization capabilities.
